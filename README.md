### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi and welcome to my profile!
I'm JÃ©rÃ©my, a ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· developer who's currently working at **Hivebrite**, Paris.

I am a JavaScript fanatic and a MVP builder. I'm developing in JS since I'm a teenager.

I always work as FullStack developer in different startups around the world. 
I work often in remote and know how to work with a remote team!
When I'm not pushing commits or debugging some Promises, I'm probably making coffee.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Ruby and Rails.

ðŸ“« Reach me directly on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MPefi).

| Project | Language |
| --- | --- |
| [Spartan Winner](https://spartanwinner.com/) | VueJS / NodeJS |
| [GetWazabi](https://www.getwazabi.com/) | ReactJS / NodeJS |
