### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi and welcome to my profile!
I'm JÃ©rÃ©my, a french developer who's currently working at Hivebrite, Paris.

I am a JavaScript fanatic and a MVP builder. I'm developing in JS since I'm a teenager.

I always work as FullStack developer in different startups around the world. 
I work often in remote and know how to work with a remote team !
When I'm not pushing commits or debugging some Promises, I'm probably making coffee.

I'm currently learning Ruby and Rails.
