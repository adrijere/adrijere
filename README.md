### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi and welcome to my profile!
I'm JÃ©rÃ©my, a ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· developer who's currently working at **Lindy**, San Francisco.

I am a JavaScript fanatic and a MVP builder. I've been developing in JS since I was a teenager.

I always work as FullStack developer in different startups around the world. 
I often work remotely and know how to work with a remote team!
When I'm not pushing commits or debugging some Promises, I'm probably making coffee.

I worked with VueJS, Rails and Golang during my previous experiences.
I'm now focusing on React, NextJS, NestJS, Python.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm learning Python.

ðŸ“« Reach me directly on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MPefi).
